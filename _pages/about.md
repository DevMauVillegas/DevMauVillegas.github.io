## Carreer in Game development

In rough numbers, I could say, as of February 2026, that I harvest about 6 years of game development experience. The dates might have gaps and on different technologies, but in what videogame industry refers it would be about right.

In spite of being interested in Videogames pretty much my whole life, it became a plausible opportunity around 2018, when I got hired in a training camp to learn proper C++ in the Gaming Studio of a large consultant company.

The training was short, only a quarter long, but in that time I master C++ and started creating dumb games with SFML to be as close as possible to the code. The project is still vissible in the gitlab repository [HERE](https://gitlab.com/dev-mau-villegas/car-shooter){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }. Is painfully old and probably terrible, but it used to work and it was the first attempt of making a videogame with code.
